# pinball-connect
Pinball IoT device that connects your pinball machine to the internet! We are currently targeting Stern SAM based pinball machines (http://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?searchtype=advanced&mpu=54). 

This repository was created to hold product issues and product documentation.  If you have an issue or would like to make a suggestion to the product, feel free to "create an issue".   Issue priority will be given to product owners, sponsors and collabrators.
